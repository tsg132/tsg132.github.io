  <h1> Stack Attack </h1>

  <h2> Sundry </h2>

  <p> This project is a group effort of Kamoni Fletcher, Samantha Flores-Eulloqui, and Tan Sarp Gerzile </p>
  
  <h2> Introduction </h2>

  <p> 
    The goal of this project is to stack a group of blocks either as a 2D pyramid (ie no length component) or a vertical tower using Rethink Sawyer robot. The reason we chose to implement this project was because it included all facets of the requirements of 106A project, ie sensing, path planning, and actuation. The interesting parts of the project became apperant later when we started the implementation. Although it seems like a trivial task, we needed to solve a lot of problems. We chose to start blocks from a random initialization, which means that all the blocks sitting on the workspace has random orientation and translation. As can be seen from the figure below, in order to stack the blocks in a successful fashion, they all need to have the same orientation first. Thus, the first problem that we needed to solve was to find the orientations (yaw) of each block after detection. Additionally, to pick the blocks up, we needed to implement path planning algorithms similar to lab 7. Additionally, in order to prevent jerky motion of the arm, we also needed to implement control. After the implementation of all these functions, we also needed to make precise adjustments so that the project worked as intended. 
    As a result, the most interesting part of this project for us was the implementing a full-stack robot application from scratch, which simulated a real world industrial robotics environment for us. Although it was frustrating from time to time, being able to complete the project was worth the frustration.

  <h2> Real World Application </h2>

  <p>
    Although the end-goal of this project is quite simple for any real world application, as with any other class project, one thing that we thought of was a volume constrained stacking of boxes for optimal packaging for an industrial setting like Amazon Robotics using Integer Linear Programming. Assume that we have a container with fixed dimensions. We have a set of boxes of different known dimensions. A robotic arm must place a subset (or all) of these boxes into the container without overlap and respecting container boundaries. We want to determine which boxes to place, how to orient them, and their exact positions. The key points of such applicatioin are: 1) Boxes can be oriented in different ways (rotating the around the three axes not just yaw). 2) Boxes must fit entirely within the container. 3) Boxes cannot overlap. 4) We may want to maximize the number of boxes placed or minimize the unused space. We can use Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to solve this problem. If you took CS 170, you know that ILP provides a powerful and flexible framework for formulating and solving combinatorial optimization problems with strictly integer solutions as opposed to linear programming The geometric of constraints of fitting boxes inside a container and enuring no overlaps can be represented using linear inequalities. ILP allows for a straightforward transtition of these geometric relationships into linear constraints. Additionally, deciding whether to place a box and in which orientation are inherently binary. ILP naturally incorporates binary variables to represent such decisions, providing a direct
     and intuitive link between the model's variables and the real world decisions. Actually, using linear programming to minimize a container like volume using different shaped blocks, was a goal of our project, but we later decided that we wouldn't have been able to implement it because it had just too many deliverables and we didn't have the time to implement such project, but then again, we will describe and formulate a model here to demonstrate how this problem could be solved. The container that we are placing the boxes has known dimensions (W, L, H) and we have N boxes with different and known dimensions, we wish to formulate an ILP model to find a solution to this system. Once the ILP solver finds a solution, we hae the exact positions and orientations of the boxes. These can be fed into the respective motion planning module of a robotic arm, enabling the arm to pick and place each box in the specified location.
